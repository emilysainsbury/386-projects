Are you new to linear regression, or has it been forever since you covered it in class? Understanding simple linear regression is the foundation for creating models, making predictions, and evidence-based decision making. So, let’s review it!

For this example, we’re going to be using a dataset called mpg, which compares a lot of different information about cars. We’ll be looking at the effect of displacement on highway gas mileage on a given car. Here’s what it looks like:

We can see there’s a bit of a downward trend in gas mileage when displacement increases. We can use regression techniques to learn if there is a relationship between the two variables, quantify the effect that displacement has on miles per gallon, and make predictions. 

# The Basic Structure of a Linear Model

𝑦𝑖=𝑁(𝛽o + 𝛽𝑖 𝑥𝑖, 𝜎^2 )
Where:
𝑦𝑖: the mpg of the ith car
𝑥𝑖: the displacement of the ith car
𝛽o: if the car’s displacement is 0, then the car will have this gas mileage (on average)
𝛽𝑖: if the car’s displacement increases by 1, the gas mileage will increase by this much on average.
𝜎^2: how far off the predicted average mpg is form the actual average mpg, on average

This formula resembles the basic formula of a line, y = mx+b. In the context of the mpg data, b is the gas mileage of a car that has 0 displacement (if that even exists), and m is the amount of change we see in highway gas mileage when you increase or decrease displacement by 1.
